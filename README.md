# Vite + Automerge + Prosemirror

This is a simple example of how to use Vite, Automerge and Prosemirror together.

First install everything

```
yarn install
```

Then run the server

```
yarn dev
```

Now if you visit `loalhost:5173` you should see a text editor. If you copy the
URL and open it in another tab (or another browser), you should see the same
text editor. Edits from one tab will be reflected in the other.
